# Session Debrief

Post-session reflection for closure and continuity. Rooted in character progression - this is where growth gets recognized.

Start with structured notes, then discuss if you want to dig deeper.

## Character Growth

Did anyone meaningfully change? Check these dimensions:

- **Internal shifts** - Beliefs changed, fears confronted, lessons learned
- **Relationships** - Bonds formed, trust broken, dynamics shifted
- **Capability/Status** - Skills demonstrated, reputation changed, resources gained/lost
- **Trajectory** - Are they heading somewhere different now than before?

Not every session has growth. That's fine. Don't force it.

## The Canonicity Filter

Before cementing any growth, run it through these tests:

- **Intentionality** - Did you (the player) lean into this, or did Claude invent it?
- **Resonance** - Does it feel true to who this character is?
- **Scale** - Is the outcome proportional to the cause? (No butterfly effects - small moments shouldn't reshape the world)

If it fails these tests, it's flavor, not canon. Let it go.

This filter exists because LLMs latch onto throwaway moments and inflate them. Not everything needs to be significant.

## What Carries Forward

- Unresolved threads to revisit
- Changed circumstances that matter
- New questions raised
- NPCs whose status shifted

## Closure

What was this session *about*?

Not a plot summary - the emotional or thematic core. One sentence if you can.

This helps the session feel complete, even if the story continues.
