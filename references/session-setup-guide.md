# Session Setup

Before diving into the session, establish these parameters. Not a checklist - prompts for a quick calibration conversation.

## Tone

- **Genre feel** - What kind of story is this? (noir, hopeful, gritty, whimsical, tense...)
- **Mood today** - What energy do you want? (quiet/reflective, high-stakes, action-heavy, emotional)

## Content Boundaries

What's on the table? What's off?

Load modifiers if needed:
- [mature-content.md](../modifiers/mature-content.md) - For authentic portrayal of dark themes
- [combat-realism.md](../modifiers/combat-realism.md) - For grounded, consequential violence

## Direction

- Which thread are we pulling?
- Opening scene - where do we pick up?
- Any specific NPCs or locations to feature?

## Pacing

- Tempo for this session (slow burn vs. rapid progression)
- Roughly how much ground to cover?
- Any hard stops or natural endpoints to aim for?

## Calibration

Before committing to play, run a quick test:

1. Describe the opening scene you have in mind
2. Have Claude set the scene in voice
3. If it feels off - wrong tone, pacing, energy - adjust now

Better to recalibrate at the start than fight the drift mid-session.
