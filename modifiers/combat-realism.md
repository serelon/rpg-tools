# Combat Realism

Combat should feel grounded and consequential, not cinematic or gamified.

## Principles

- **Violence is dangerous** - Even skilled fighters can be injured or killed by bad luck
- **Actions have weight** - No consequence-free heroics
- **Wounds matter** - Injuries affect performance and require recovery
- **Numbers matter** - Being outnumbered is genuinely perilous
- **Environment matters** - Terrain, visibility, and positioning affect outcomes

## Avoid

- Plot armor for protagonists
- Mooks who exist only to be defeated
- Clean, sanitized violence without cost
- Instant recovery from serious injury

## Remember

The threat of death creates stakes. If combat can't go wrong, it's just description.
